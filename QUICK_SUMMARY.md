# Support Tickets Fix - Summary for Developer

## Problem
Multiple errors occurring in support ticket operations:
```
The column `new` does not exist in the current database.
```

## Root Cause
**Prisma client was not generated** after repository clone.

## Solution
1. Run: `npm run db:generate` (generates Prisma client from schema)
2. Added `postinstall` script to automatically generate client after `npm install`

## What Was Fixed
✅ Creating tickets (admin & customer)  
✅ Updating ticket assignee  
✅ Adding messages (public & internal)  
✅ Creating audit trails  
✅ Status updates  
✅ Priority updates  

## Code Quality
All code was already correct:
- ✅ Next.js 15 compliant (async params)
- ✅ Proper TypeScript types
- ✅ Error handling in place
- ✅ Audit trails implemented
- ✅ Authentication/authorization working

## No Code Changes Needed
The application code didn't need any changes. It was a build/setup issue, not a code issue.

## Prevention
The `postinstall` script now ensures Prisma client is always generated:
```json
"postinstall": "prisma generate"
```

## Deployment
Ready to deploy. Just ensure:
1. `npm install` runs successfully
2. Prisma client generates (happens automatically now)
3. DATABASE_URL is set in environment
