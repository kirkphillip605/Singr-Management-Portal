# FusionAuth Integration - Implementation Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the implementation of FusionAuth as the authentication provider for the Singr Billing Portal.

## Changes Made

### 1. Environment Configuration (`.env.example`)
Updated to include FusionAuth configuration:
- `FUSIONAUTH_ISSUER` - FusionAuth server URL (https://auth.singrkaraoke.com)
- `FUSIONAUTH_CLIENT_ID` - Application client ID
- `FUSIONAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET` - Application client secret
- `FUSIONAUTH_TENANT_ID` - Tenant ID for multi-tenant setup
- `FUSIONAUTH_REQUIRED_ROLE` - Required role for billing portal access (customer_owner)
- Public variables for client-side use (NEXT_PUBLIC_FUSIONAUTH_*)

### 2. Authentication Configuration (`src/lib/auth.ts`)
Replaced the previous authentication setup with FusionAuth:
- **Removed**: Credentials provider and Google OAuth provider
- **Added**: FusionAuth OAuth 2.0/OpenID Connect provider
- **JWT Callback**: 
  - Creates or retrieves SingrUser based on FusionAuth user ID
  - Determines account type (admin/customer/singer) from profiles
  - Stores roles from FusionAuth in session
- **Session Callback**: 
  - Includes FusionAuth user ID, roles, and profile information
  - Maintains backward compatibility with existing session structure

### 3. Type Definitions (`src/types/next-auth.d.ts`)
Extended NextAuth types to include:
- `fusionauthUserId` - Link to FusionAuth user
- `singrUserId` - Link to SingrUser record
- `customerProfileId` - Link to CustomerProfile
- `roles` - Array of FusionAuth roles

### 4. Sign-In Page (`src/app/auth/signin/page.tsx`)
Simplified to use FusionAuth OAuth:
- Removed email/password form
- Added "Sign in with FusionAuth" button
- Redirects to FusionAuth authorization endpoint

### 5. Sign-Up Page (`src/app/auth/signup/page.tsx`)
Updated to redirect to FusionAuth registration:
- Removed registration form
- Added "Register with FusionAuth" button
- Constructs FusionAuth registration URL with proper redirect

### 6. Role Checking Utilities (`src/lib/role-check.ts`)
Created helper functions for role-based access control:
- `hasCustomerOwnerRole()` - Check for customer_owner role
- `hasBillingPortalAccess()` - Combined check for customer account and required role

### 7. Documentation
Created comprehensive documentation:
- **FUSIONAUTH_INTEGRATION.md** - Complete integration guide including:
  - Environment setup
  - OAuth endpoints and configuration
  - Authentication flows
  - Role-based access control
  - Database schema details
  - Testing and troubleshooting
- **README.md** - Updated to reference FusionAuth integration

## Technical Details

### OAuth Flow
1. User clicks "Sign in with FusionAuth"
2. Redirect to FusionAuth authorization endpoint
3. User authenticates with FusionAuth
4. FusionAuth redirects to `/api/auth/callback/fusionauth`
5. NextAuth exchanges code for tokens
6. JWT callback creates/updates SingrUser
7. Session established with user data and roles

### User Management
- First-time users are automatically created in the database
- FusionAuth user ID is stored in `SingrUser.fusionauthUserId`
- Profile type determined by existing AdminProfile/CustomerProfile/SingerProfile
- New users default to customer profile type

### Role-Based Access
- Roles are extracted from FusionAuth token
- Stored in session JWT for quick access
- Helper functions provided for role checking
- Required role configurable via environment variable

## Security Considerations

1. **Client Secret**: Kept server-side only, never exposed to client
2. **Role Verification**: Server-side validation before granting access
3. **Session Management**: JWT-based with NextAuth
4. **CodeQL Scan**: Passed with zero vulnerabilities
5. **HTTPS**: All FusionAuth endpoints use HTTPS

## Testing

To test the integration:
1. Set up FusionAuth environment variables
2. Ensure FusionAuth application is configured with correct redirect URLs
3. Assign customer_owner role to test users
4. Navigate to `/auth/signin` and test login flow
5. Verify session contains correct user data and roles

## Migration Path

For existing users:
1. Create corresponding users in FusionAuth
2. Update SingrUser records with fusionauthUserId
3. Assign appropriate roles in FusionAuth
4. Users can then log in via FusionAuth

## Files Changed

- `.env.example` - Added FusionAuth configuration
- `src/lib/auth.ts` - Implemented FusionAuth OAuth provider
- `src/types/next-auth.d.ts` - Extended session types
- `src/app/auth/signin/page.tsx` - Updated to use FusionAuth
- `src/app/auth/signup/page.tsx` - Redirect to FusionAuth registration
- `src/lib/role-check.ts` - Created role checking utilities
- `FUSIONAUTH_INTEGRATION.md` - New comprehensive documentation
- `README.md` - Updated authentication section

## Conclusion

The FusionAuth integration is complete and ready for deployment. All authentication flows now go through FusionAuth, with proper role-based access control for the billing portal. The implementation is minimal, focused, and maintains compatibility with the existing database schema.
