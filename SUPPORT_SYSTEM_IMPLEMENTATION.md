# Support System Implementation Summary

## Overview
This document outlines the complete implementation of the admin-side support ticket system and fixes for bogus route references in the Singr Management Portal.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Removed Bogus Route References
- **Venue Management Page (`/src/app/dashboard/venues/[id]/page.tsx`)**
  - Removed non-existent link to `/venue/${venue.urlName}` that was causing 404 errors
  - This route doesn't exist and was generating unnecessary prefetch requests in the browser console

- **Songs Page (`/src/app/dashboard/songs/page.tsx`)**
  - Removed non-existent links to `/dashboard/songs/upload` route
  - This route doesn't exist and was causing 404 errors in the browser console
  - Updated empty state messaging to reflect the route removal

## Support System Implementation

### Customer-Side Support (Already Existed)
The customer-side support ticket system was already fully functional:
- Create new support tickets with attachments
- View ticket details and conversation history
- Reply to tickets with attachments
- Proper file validation (10MB limit, specific file types allowed)

### Admin-Side Support (Newly Implemented)

#### 1. Admin Support Pages

**Admin Support Dashboard (`/src/app/admin/support/page.tsx`)**
- Displays all support tickets across all customers
- Shows ticket counts by status (Open, Pending Support, Pending Customer, Resolved, Closed)
- Lists recent tickets with key information:
  - Subject and requester
  - Current assignee
  - Message count
  - Last update time
  - Status and priority badges
  - Urgent ticket indicators

**Admin Ticket Detail Page (`/src/app/admin/support/[ticketId]/page.tsx`)**
- Full ticket conversation view
- Shows both public and internal messages
- Ticket metadata sidebar with:
  - Requester information (with link to user profile)
  - Assignment information
  - Status and priority
  - Creation and update timestamps
- Action panel for ticket management
- Reply form for public responses and internal notes

#### 2. Admin Components

**AdminTicketActions (`/src/components/admin/admin-ticket-actions.tsx`)**
Client-side component for managing tickets:
- Update ticket status (Open, Pending Support, Pending Customer, Resolved, Closed)
- Change ticket priority (Low, Normal, High, Urgent)
- Assign/unassign tickets to admin/support users
- Real-time updates with toast notifications
- Automatic page refresh after changes

**AdminTicketReplyForm (`/src/components/admin/admin-ticket-reply-form.tsx`)**
Client-side component for responding to tickets:
- Toggle between public replies (visible to customers) and internal notes (staff-only)
- Support for file attachments (same validation as customer-side)
- Clear visual indicators for message visibility
- Automatic status updates based on reply type
- Form validation and error handling

#### 3. Enhanced Shared Components

**SupportTicketMessageThread (Updated)**
- Added `showInternal` prop to display internal notes for admins
- Visual distinction for internal messages (yellow background)
- Account type detection to show proper author labels
- Filters messages based on visibility when appropriate

#### 4. Admin API Endpoints

**Status Update (`/src/app/api/admin/support/tickets/[ticketId]/status/route.ts`)**
- PATCH endpoint to update ticket status
- Validates status values
- Automatically sets `closedAt` timestamp when ticket is closed
- Creates audit trail entry
- Requires admin/support authentication

**Priority Update (`/src/app/api/admin/support/tickets/[ticketId]/priority/route.ts`)**
- PATCH endpoint to update ticket priority
- Validates priority values
- Creates audit trail entry
- Requires admin/support authentication

**Assignee Update (`/src/app/api/admin/support/tickets/[ticketId]/assign/route.ts`)**
- PATCH endpoint to assign/unassign tickets
- Validates assignee exists and has proper account type
- Supports null assigneeId for unassignment
- Creates audit trail entry
- Requires admin/support authentication

**Admin Messages (`/src/app/api/admin/support/tickets/[ticketId]/messages/route.ts`)**
- POST endpoint for admin replies and internal notes
- Supports both 'public' and 'internal' visibility
- Handles file attachments with same validation as customer-side
- Automatically updates ticket status when sending public replies
- Includes message history context for public replies
- Creates proper audit trail
- Requires admin/support authentication

#### 5. Admin Navigation Update

**AdminNav Component (`/src/components/admin-nav.tsx`)**
- Added "Support Tickets" navigation item linking to `/admin/support`

#### 6. Admin Authentication Enhancement

**Admin Auth (`/src/lib/admin-auth.ts`)**
- Updated to support both 'admin' and 'support' account types
- Ensures consistent authentication across all admin pages and API endpoints
- Maintains proper access control for super_admin features

## File Attachment System

The attachment system (which already existed) supports:

### Supported File Types
- **Images**: .jpg, .jpeg, .png, .gif, .webp, .heic
- **Videos**: .mp4, .mov, .mkv, .avi
- **Documents**: .pdf, .doc, .docx, .xls, .xlsx, .ppt, .pptx, .txt, .rtf

### File Validation
- Maximum size: 10MB per file
- Maximum attachments: 5 per message/ticket
- Validation by MIME type and file extension
- Proper error messages for validation failures

### Storage
- Files stored in `public/uploads/support/{ticketId}/` directory
- Unique UUID-based filenames to prevent collisions
- Directory structure auto-created as needed
- Cleanup on transaction failure
- `.gitignore` already configured to exclude uploads

### Database Schema
Attachments are properly tracked in the `SupportMessageAttachment` table with:
- File name
- MIME type
- Size in bytes
- Storage URL for retrieval

## Security Considerations

1. **Authentication & Authorization**
   - All admin endpoints require admin/support account type
   - Customer endpoints validate ticket ownership
   - Proper session validation throughout

2. **File Upload Security**
   - File type whitelist (no executable files)
   - Size limits enforced
   - Files stored outside of code execution paths
   - UUID-based filenames prevent path traversal

3. **Data Validation**
   - All API inputs validated with Zod schemas
   - SQL injection prevention via Prisma ORM
   - XSS prevention through React's automatic escaping

4. **Audit Trail**
   - All ticket changes logged in `SupportTicketAudit` table
   - Tracks actor, action, old values, and new values
   - Timestamps for all changes

## Testing Recommendations

While no automated tests were added (as requested for minimal changes), the following should be manually tested:

1. **Admin Ticket Management**
   - [ ] View ticket list as admin
   - [ ] Filter/sort tickets by status
   - [ ] Open individual ticket details
   - [ ] Change ticket status
   - [ ] Change ticket priority
   - [ ] Assign/unassign tickets
   - [ ] Send public reply
   - [ ] Add internal note
   - [ ] Upload attachments in replies

2. **Customer Experience**
   - [ ] Create new ticket with attachments
   - [ ] View ticket list
   - [ ] Open ticket details
   - [ ] Reply to ticket with attachments
   - [ ] Verify internal notes are hidden

3. **Integration Points**
   - [ ] Verify navigation works in admin panel
   - [ ] Confirm proper redirects for unauthorized access
   - [ ] Test attachment downloads
   - [ ] Validate file type restrictions
   - [ ] Test file size limits

## Conclusion

All requirements from the problem statement have been addressed:

✅ Fixed bogus venue link causing 404 errors
✅ Fixed bogus songs/upload links causing 404 errors
